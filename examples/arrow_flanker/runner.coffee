          Welcome to the Experiment!
          ==========================

          On every trial a central arrow will appear surrounded by arrows on either side.
          Your goal is to focus on the central arrow and decide whether it points left or right.

            * If the central arrow points <-- left, press the 'g' key.

            * If the central arrow points --> right, press the 'h' key.

            * If your response is correct, the screen will briefly turn green.

            * If your response is incorrect, the screen will briefly turn red.

            * make your decision as fast as you can.

          Press any key to continue
